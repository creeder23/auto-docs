Automated Documentation Description

The Automated Documentation process was developed to maximize efficiency of the
documentation and produce relavent documentation for tasks available on the GBDX platform.

The current process for documenting a task is arduous and time consuming. Multiple stages of documentation, reformatting and handoffs must occur between steakholders in the process before a
task documentation is considered complete on gbdx university.  To streamline and automate this process, the following steps have been proposed.  The steps are orfanized from least difficult to most difficiul to impliment

1) Develop a standardized format for GitHUB documentation.  This standard document will serve as the template for all existing and future tasks added to the gbdx platform

2) Automate the template population process.  Whereby a script will parse and copy the corresponding information from the Docker container json workflow to the document template.
This will Eliminate the tedious work of filling in the document with information available in the task workflow definition

3) Populate both the quickstart and advanced gbdxtools snippits from script files developed previously

4) Curate json workflow definitions previously uploaded to GBDX to match the correct document description as it is

5) Add python code as a comment into the Json workflow in order to combine the latest working task definition with the latest code update.
Adding the code directly to the workflow definition would provide a homebase for all aspects of the task
